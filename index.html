        <p class="p">My hobby is singing. I find it intresting and enjoyable. I also sing to de-stress after a long day of school. My friend love singing too, especially my bestfriend Saachi. I go to sangeetha classes. My sangeetha teacher's name is Shylaja and she is my aunt. I like my sangeetha classes. I like all genres, but my favourite genres are jazz and hip-hop. My favourite artists are Ed Sheeren, Taylor Swift and Camilla Cabello. I don't really have any favourite songs as I like most songs. Me and my best friend Saachi always talk about the latest songs. We spend two hour talking on the phone and twenty to twenty five minutes of it is talking about the latest songs. In school, our music teacher likes my and Saachi's singing. I know this not about singing, but me and Saachi know how to play flutes. It is also said that singing is good to help lower stress, boost immunity and lung function, enhance memory, improve mental health, and helps cope with physical and emotional pain(I learnt this from music theory as I am going to write my sangeetha junior exam next year). In the end of the day, I love singing.</p>
